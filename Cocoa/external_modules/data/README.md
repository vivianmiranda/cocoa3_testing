# Cocoa - The [Cobaya](https://github.com/CobayaSampler)-[CosmoLike](https://github.com/CosmoLike) Joint Architecture

# Overview

**The Cobaya-Data repository contains data files required to run external likelihoods**, including DES-Y1, SN (both [Pantheon](https://github.com/dscolnic/Pantheon) and [JLA](http://supernovae.in2p3.fr/sdss_snls_jla/ReadMe.html) datasets), [Planck](https://wiki.cosmos.esa.int/planck-legacy-archive/index.php/Main_Page) and synthetic DES-Y3 simulated data vector and covariance. This repository does require [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com) and libraries that can uncompress [xz file format](https://tukaani.org/xz/format.html), as most data files are compressed. We advise users to have a fast internet connection to clone this repository.

### Do not clone the Cobaya-Data repository explicitly; this is a submodule of [Cocoa's main repo](https://github.com/CosmoLike/cocoa).
