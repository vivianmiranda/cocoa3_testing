# Cocoa - The [Cobaya](https://github.com/CobayaSampler)-[CosmoLike](https://github.com/CosmoLike) Joint Architecture

# Overview

**The Pristine-Code repository contains compressed files for libraries that are required by Cobaya**. 
The number of cached libraries is extensive, intended to allow easy installation of Cobaya in supercomputers without a comprehensive module system and internet connection on nodes reserved for interactive jobs (ex: NASA Pleiades). Pristine-Code repository does require [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com), so big files can be properly fetched. Files are compressed in the [xz file format](https://tukaani.org/xz/format.html).

### Do not clone the Pristine-Code repository explicitly; this is a submodule of [Cocoa's main repo](https://github.com/CosmoLike/cocoa).
